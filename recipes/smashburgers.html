        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Smashburgers are hamburgers that are pressed down on a cooking surface to make a delicious brown crust. All you need is a cast iron pan!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Potato buns</li>
                <li>Canola Oil</li>
                <li>80/20 ground beef</li>
                <li>American Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat cast iron pan over high heat and butter your buns.</li>
                <li>Once pan is hot place buns on pan to toast them. Check buns occasionally until they are golden brown.</li>
                <li>Once buns are toasted pour 1/4 tsp of canola oil on the pan and swirl it, covering the pan. Let the oil heat until shimmering</li>
                <li>Take 4 ounces of chop meat and make it into a ball. Using an offset spatula place the meat on the pan and press down on it. Let the burger cook until the sides start to brown then flip it.</li>
                <li>If using cheese, place a slice of American cheese on top of the burger. Once the cheese is melting down the sides the burger is cooked. Place on bun and serve with your desired toppings.</li>
